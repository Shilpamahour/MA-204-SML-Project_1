Course Project1: Machine Learning Algorithm for Disease Classification

Problem 
Complete Dataset consists of 2 CSV files attached in the assignment. One of them is training and other is for testing your model. Each CSV file has 133 columns. 132 of these columns are symptoms that a person experiences and last column is the prognosis. These symptoms are mapped to 42 diseases you can classify these set of symptoms to. You are required to train your model on training data and test it on testing data.

Objectives:

Used any four supervised ML models and compare their performances.
Apply dimensional reduction technique (PCA) on data and see how the classification accuracy decreases as the dimension is reduced. Plot a graph between classification accuracy and number of PCA features.
Apply Random Forest algorithm and tune the hyper-parameters for getting the best classification accuracy.

Solution :
I will be using the following 4 supervised machine learning algorithms:

(i) Decision Tree Classifier
(ii) Support Vector Classifier(linear)
(ii) Naive Bayes Classifier
(iv) Softmax Regression (multiclass Logistic)


Result:
I was able to achieve a classification accuracy of:

Classification Algorithm Used	Accuracy
Decision Tree Classifier	    97.61904761904762%
Naive Bayes Classifier	        100.0%
Support Vector Classifier	    100.0%
Softmax Classifier	            97.61904761904762%
